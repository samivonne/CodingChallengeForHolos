This is the coding challenge for Holos. 

Here are the requirements: 
Create a simple game. Add a playfield with two goal zones, one on each side of the field. 
Create a simple character controller that lets a player wander around the field. 
Add a hefty ball-like object to the playfield that can't easily be moved by the player. 
Give the player a gravity-gun [1] that lets them pick up the ball and shoot it into the goal zones.  
(Optional) Create a simple floating agent that can steer itself around the world and either chase the player and/or block the goal. 
  Add a bunch of them and let them swarm.
